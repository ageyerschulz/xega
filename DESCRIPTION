Description:
        Implementation of a scalable, highly configurable, 
        and extendible architecture for evolutionary and genetic algorithms.
        Multiple representations (binary, real-coded, permutation, and 
        derivation-tree), a rich collection of genetic operators, 
        as well as an extended processing pipeline are provided 
        for genetic algorithms, differential evolution, 
        simulated annealing, grammar-based genetic programming, and grammatical 
        evolution. All algorithms reuse basic adaptive mechanisms
        for performance optimization.
        Sequential or parallel execution (on multi-core machines, 
        local clusters, and high performance computing environments) 
        is available for all algorithms.
